From 2021 I have been working from the OVO office in Bristol. I am pro remote working generally, I like the flexibility, peace and quiet, but a post-covid corporate office is pretty peaceful and it was just down the road.

I wanted to keep some pictures of my desk setup somewhere to archive them. Although basic it felt like I managed to create a bit of personality there in the wasteland of old furniture and empty desks.
